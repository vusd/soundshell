TWO SECURITY GUARDS TALKING ABOUT JUPITER.
Four little canvas bags of takings, one float, one 
cash box and two guards to open the security room 
where the squat safe is waiting. End of day ritual

but tonight they are talking of Jupiter 
in male fashion. Did you see that 
TV programme? About what the Earth

will be like when it dries out? A prune 
sinking in on itself, a dust bowl falling 
inwards like the orchestrated blowing up

of a building that comes down on the 
spot ordained. Jupiter, on the contrary, 
is a crystal planet. How strange, fitting

the cash bags in, pushing the cash box back 
turning the handle so the teeth of the door mesh 
and the maker’s gold seal glows in the light

then finally the long thin key that someone 
locked in the room might turn to open 
to take out the bags and play with the money

but be unable to escape because the door 
is deadbolted. Walking away, thinking 
how like a little safe this planet is

locked tight, we trust, for the night 
its systems meshed. Earth preserved in its 
abundant waters, Jupiter in its dark moonlets.
