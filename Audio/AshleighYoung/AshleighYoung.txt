Certain Trees.

One tree pretends to throw things 
and the wind goes sprinting, then skids, turns – 
ha! sucked in again, old wind! 

One tree chooses to be apart, 
like a door halfway up a wall. 
My window groans with the weight 

of trees 
staking their territory. Humpbacked trees, 
shipwrecks of trees 

with piano keys inside 
like the Titanic. Certain trees sway 
holding lighted leaves up 

as a voice sings out of a man 
inside my neighbour's radio.
why you on your own tonight? 
The ones you shun always come back 

to sing at you. 
Certain trees reach for a woman 
who is handing washing to the wind, a shirt 

by the arms, pants by the waist, socks 
by the feet; 
handing over parts of the body has never 
been so easy. 

The wind sprints past the window again 
it gets dark quickly 
and certain trees reach for me.
