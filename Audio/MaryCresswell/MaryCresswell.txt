Golden Weather (Cook Strait).


Nana died on Boxing Day. 
we left Makara in kayaks

we paddled all night, we paddled away. 
Dad steered to the Southern Cross.

we lashed the dog to a boogie board 
and ate cold cheerios with tomato sauce.

Porpoises played as we packed our sad. 
at dawn we skimmed the swells

the yellow Lab sank beneath the waves 
Farewell, wept Mum, farewell.

At high noon Nana was bronzed 
we swallowed grief and sausage rolls.

Not before time we left for home. 
we turned our backs on the day

goodbye, we cried, you golden sun! 
goodbye, goodbye, you yellow dog!
