SACRED DAYS.
How I stalled, 
hiding inside my head, 
liking it there, cushioned. 
Being in the world 
as it was unfolding,

with the sun shining neat 
on to footpaths, the rain's 
dribble on to hedges 
and patient mail-boxes. 
the smell of cooped-up budgies,

the deep, warm bath 
nine o'clock at night. 
the creak of the passage; 
all things that cluster 
to form a town were bearable

if the edges were woolly 
with fabrications. Rhododendrons 
and marigolds to soften front yards. 
The high school's highly-polished corridors, 
shadowed bike-sheds,

lagged pipes in the pre-fabs. 
The sound of clocks, of wooden walls 
relaxing behind wallpaper. 
The smell of coal. 
All framework for dreams.

Oh and let's not forget 
the heartbreak. the heartbreak 
of newly-mown grass, 
of any and every awful beauty. 
Yes, and that ache

of double-hung windows, 
of looking out at a world where hills 
meet sky. the outside world, 
its whole big, blue bluster, 
its yodel and strut.
