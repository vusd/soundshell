big bed.


Close the little papa’s eyes, 
close’m eyes, close’m eyes.

Sleepy baby with the goldfish lips, 
deep dark lashes, angel-pink cheeks,

ears like truffles, or hatchcovers 
for underground shelters.

Darling baby with the snotty snout, 
swept-back ‘in flight’ hair,

the tightly closed lashes 
of a president embalmed

in a coffin of dreams, under the eye 
of the gaudy activity bear.

Ellis’s Arepa Omeka —
a tattooed, rope-wristed

hand and a fish —
the poster of Barney and friends.

The curtains shuffle in an easterly.
Tamarisk feathers fade yellow, fade green

in a sea of moist air and chimney pots.
Not a palace, but cheerful,

this little house and warm. 
We have an angel in the bed with us.

chafed fluey nostrils and wide
globed brow, his right arm flung

between her face and mine,
the left left out on the covers.

Spider-red capillaries on shut lids,
Chanel lips succulent as anemones,

nipple-blistered still at twenty months.
Her ring-finger hand covers one breast.

He sucks the other and fiddles
with my penis with his foot.
