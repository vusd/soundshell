THE MONGOLIAN WOMEN'S ORCHESTRA.
enter the Mongolian Women's Band 
with 
the years,

 

whose music, theirs and theirs, like language learned, 
inevitable, red and super-sound, 
outplays the days the days that made it mine.

 

and beauty beauty adds to it. its stir, 
its wink, its melt, and anything that shines.
this is The Horse that Overtook the Wind.

 

the little men that ride the plain 
on hearts that will not race again 
whose hoofbeats knock on heaven's door – 
they will not come back anymore.

the history of hope is short : 
it has one chapter – Youth. I thought 
that memories would make me wise 
but nothing comes as no surprise.

across the windy open spaces 
briefly bright their shining faces 
do with beauty then are gone 
the horses gallop on and on.

 

and if I played my darndest, darndest card, 
who have no beauty now, no more, what tricks 
I take have not the hearts they had before.

 

The Horse that Overtook the Wind is done, 
and beauty beauty raced it well – its stir, 
its wink, its melt and anything that shines.

 

exit the Mongolian Women's Band 
with 
the years.
