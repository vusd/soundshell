LIKE RAIN THE THUNDER.

inside the tall gothic church 
a man kisses the pieta.

max is at the organ 
composing a creation hymn

called apple and snow. 
all night the wind

wraps itself around the city 
like a bell that does

not ring in danger but prayer 
and genya’s voice

falls from a clock 
as she calls her children

kazia, stefan, hendrich, janek 
her hand closes around

a winter apple 
and somebody probably kazia

puts the kettle on. 
then all four children

gather their shadows 
and become birds.
