LONE KAURI (REPRISE).
So take for starters the surge-black fissure, 
the waves which register the lunatic sense 
it is all well beyond us. Our flooded nature

rages at the dying light, measures 
its measures down some lone goat-track, 
works up some incorrigible reprise

on grace, etc, a tuning fork 
striking itself out of true on the table 
of the elements. But blow, burn, break

and be done with it. baptism will 
look like this, the flailing, the flensing of waves 
and the breath knocked into you, the haul

that finds you first-footing land, brings 
the morning. Forgive my making light of 
the glass half-empty and you weighing up the dregs.

but I will get up like a love-cast father 
awakening to children’s voices, the night- 
time true underfoot, who hears their laughter

and finds, at the unclosed door, the seam of light.
