Rose and fell.

Moist geometry unfurls.
          Dawn flushes the birds 
from their silence.

hectic petticoats trimmed 
with disappearing mist.
and there, under a shaggy hem

of pines, the monster Grendel
stealing home, mouth full 
of pinking shears.

His rough palm grips the bruised
root of a plant torn 
from a mountainside

releasing scent of a more
legendary bloom. 

His pelt
glistens. the girl’s words 
trapped moths
in his uncomprehending ears.

Wings of flowers 
fall and star 
the path behind him.

as he travels
swiftly over the ground 
breathing     breathing.
