WOMENS BUSINESS.
When I had a son in his early teens 
a Russian thought formed in my head. 
that if a war came I would cut off 
the index finger of his right hand 
so that he would be no use for fighting. 
The part of me which visits 
hospitals would do the cutting. 
I wouldn’t care if he hated me 
for what I did. 
I might even be pleased. 
By this time I knew that he was nearly 
a man, and that if I didn’t cut his finger off 
or shoot him in the foot, he would go. 
Even if he was afraid. 
Even if he thought it was pointless. 
Now he is a man and I ask him 
to carry my suitcase.
