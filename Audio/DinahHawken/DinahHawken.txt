365 x 30.

Lying on a bed with you
for at least 
the ten thousandth time. 
I remember the dream 
I had last night.

You and I and the young woman
you are going to marry 
are in a shop 
choosing a jacket for you 
to wear at the wedding. 
She chooses an absurd one 
with taffeta panels on the front
and full gathered sleeves.
I see that your old one 
the one you are wearing
is plain and smart. It suits you.

In the dream I do not speak 
or act. I am there
as your friend, being reasonable
about the marriage — 
but there is a distinct
holding in my shoulders
as if our days together
are taking a shape
that I am about to reach out
and raise
above all else.

a double-handled jar
in which water turns to wine.
