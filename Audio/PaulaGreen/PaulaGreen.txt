Waitakere Rain.


Ernest Hemingway found rain to be
made of knowledge, experience
wine oil salt vinegar quince.
bed early mornings nights days the sea.
men women dogs hill and rich valley.
the appearance and disappearance of sense
or trains on curved and straight tracks, hence.
love honour and dishonour, a scent of infinity.
In my city the rain you get
is made of massive kauri trees, the call of forest birds
howling dark oceans and mangroved creeks.
I taste constancy, memory and yet
there’s the watery departure of words
from the thunder-black sand at Te Henga Beach.
